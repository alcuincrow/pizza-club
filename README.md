# Project overview
The goal of this project with Codecademy was to make a responsive club website. Utilizing responsive sizing units and media queries. 

I made a simple and responsive landing page about a fictional pizza and book club. 
That meets up bi-weekly to discuss that book and enjoy eating pizza together at a local restaurant. 
I utilized stock images from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).
